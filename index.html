<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">All four indicators are the opposite. Their main function (primary function) has the power to complement each other's sub-functions (the inferior part) Each other's secondary functions also have the power to complement each other's tertiary functions.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">Judging type opponents complement the Perceiving Type opponent's idle, immediate and unplanned instructions.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">This relationship is the most appropriate and comfortable relationship among all types of dynamics. A duality relationship is a relationship that perfectly complements and understands each other. These two types can achieve a perfect one, the whole.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;They can praise each other's strengths and safeguard each other's weaknesses naturally, without having to come back and understand each other's intentions.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;If there is something called true love in the world, it will be a relationship that people in the duality relationship share. In this relationship, you do not have to try to match your opponent like in other relationships. You can expose it as it is without guessing it. It is this relationship that can be exposed and tolerated as it is.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;In this relationship, even if there is a conflict, it is very brief and resolves without pain. If a person loves the other person in this relationship, it is in love with the person as it is.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;This relationship is theoretically the most perfect relationship, but even if it is the best match, practically none of these types of people will produce such a fantastic compatibility. The reason is that due to the various situations and events we are experiencing in our lives, we have created our stereotypes and frameworks, which have a profound effect on our relationships.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">In order for this relationship to be an ideal relationship, at least two things are needed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;One is feeling a little crush on each other, the second is more important than anything else, it is the same or similar that two people pursue or aspirate. This includes things like common interests or life goals. Whether or not they are both serious and important about building a wonderful family is one such example. Logically speaking, each of the only half that is together must not resist or move in the other direction. Then the whole is broken into pieces.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;This relationship is also subject to several phases.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">The first step is a tension relationship to each other. The first goes away with this tension. The more tough you go through the many steps, the harder and firmer your relationship will be. It is very difficult to know the best partner for my personality, and we pass it too easily.</font><font face="cambria math" color="black"></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="cambria math" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="cambria math" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="cambria math" color="black">&nbsp;</font><font face="gabriola" color="black">Usually, a partner with an outward form (E) at first gets into a relationship with an introverted (I) partner while comfortably and lightly thinking. The introverted partner sees an outward partner and thinks that he can not develop too deeply into a deep relationship with himself. They both do not realize at first that there is a relationship that really fits each other in the relationship.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;The two types in this relationship do not know when they are together, but when they have some time apart, they feel like they are attracted to each other like magnets.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="gabriola" color="black">After spending a lot of time together, they realize how much the other person was needed for him. In the end, they have the most perfect relationship in achieving friendship, marriage, and family life. Partners in this relationship will be very important and can be of great help when you overcome a difficult social environment.<br /><br /></font></p>
